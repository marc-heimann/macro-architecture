== API Naming


=== Must: Use lowercase separate words with hyphens for Path Segments

Example:

----
/shipment-orders/{shipment-order-id}
----

This applies to concrete path segments and not the names of path parameters. 
For example `{shipment_order_id}` would be ok as a path parameter.

=== Must: Use camelCase for Query Parameters

Examples:

`customerNumber, orderId, billingAddress`

=== Should: Prefer Hyphenated-Pascal-Case for HTTP header Fields

This is for consistency in your documentation (most other headers follow this convention). 
Avoid camelCase (without hyphens). Exceptions are common abbreviations like “ID.”

Examples:

----
Accept-Encoding
Apply-To-Redirect-Ref
Disposition-Notification-Options
Original-Message-ID
----

See also: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#page-22[HTTP Headers are case-insensitive (RFC 7230)].

=== Must: Pluralize Resource Names

Usually, a collection of resource instances is provided (at least API should be ready here). 
The special case of a resource singleton is a collection with cardinality 1.

=== Must: Use /api as first Path Segment

In most cases, all resources provided by a service are part of the public API, 
and therefore should be made available under the root “/” base path. 
If the service should also support non-public, 
internal APIs -- for specific operational support functions, for example --
add “/api” as base path to clearly separate public and non-public API resources.

=== Must: Avoid Trailing Slashes

The trailing slash must not have specific semantics. 
Resource paths must deliver the same results whether they have the trailing slash or not.

=== May: Use Conventional Query Strings

If you provide query support for sorting, pagination, filtering
functions or other actions, use the following standardized naming
conventions:


* `limit` -- to restrict the number of entries. 
See Pagination section below. Hint: You can use size as an alternate query string.

* `cursor` -- key-based page start. See <<Pagination>> section below.

* `offset` -- numeric offset page start. See <<Pagination>> section below.
Hint: In combination with limit, you can use page as an alternative to
offset.

* `sort` -- comma-separated list of fields to sort. 
To indicate sorting direction, 
fields may be prefixed with + (ascending) or - (descending, default), e.g. /sales-orders?sort=+id

* `fields` -- to retrieve a subset of fields.

* `embed` -- to expand embedded entities (ie.: inside of an article entity, expand silhouette code into the silhouette object). Implementing “expand” correctly is difficult, so do it with care.
