=== Must: Use REST Maturity Level 3 - HATEOAS

Each Self Contained System provides access to its resources via https://martinfowler.com/articles/richardsonMaturityModel.html[[underline]#RESTful API Level 3#] which is referred by the HATEOAS acronym.

HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State) is a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS[[underline]#constraint of the REST application architecture#].
A hypermedia-driven site provides information to navigate the siteâ€™s REST interfaces dynamically by including hypermedia links with the responses.


=== Must: HATEOAS according the HAL specification

The Self Contained Systems realize HATEOAS according the http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html[[underline]#HAL#] specification (HAL+JSON).

=== Must: Client discovers resources via links

Client have to follow the links and are not allowed to take shortcuts by directly target resources without 'discovering' them.

=== Must: Provide root entry point for discovery

To allow discoverability of resources by clients,
provide a resource via the root entry point (`/api`) with links to all public resources.

Example response for: `http://localhost:8080/bag-unloader/api`

{
  "_links": {
    "self": {
      "href": "http://localhost:8080/bag-unloader/api"
    },
    "packages": {
      "href": "http://localhost:8080/bag-unloader/api/packages"
    },
    "workstations": {
      "href": "http://localhost:8080/bag-unloader/api/workstations"
    }
  }
}

=== Must: Use full, absolute URI

Links to other resource must always use full, absolute URI.

**Motiviation**: Exposing any form of relative URI (no matter if the relative URI uses 
an absolute or relative path) introduces avoidable client side complexity. 
It also requires clarity on the base URI, which might not be given when using features like embedding sub-resources.
